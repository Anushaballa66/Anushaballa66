IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP), widely used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system. Below are some key aspects of IPv4:

1. Address Format
IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, represented in a dotted decimal format, like 192.168.1.1.
Each address consists of four octets, with each octet representing 8 bits (one byte). The values range from 0 to 255.
2. Address Classes
IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Classes A, B, and C are used for general unicast traffic, while classes D and E have specialized purposes.
Class A: Large networks, 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
Class B: Medium-sized networks, 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255.
Class C: Small networks, 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.
Class D: Multicasting, 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
Class E: Reserved for future use, 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
3. Subnetting
IPv4 supports subnetting, where an IP address can be divided into network and host portions. This is done to efficiently allocate IP addresses within a larger network.
Subnetting uses a subnet mask like 255.255.255.0 to define how many bits are used for the network versus the host.
4. Private and Public IPs
Public IP addresses are routable on the internet and are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
Private IP addresses are used within private networks and are not routable on the public internet. Common private IP ranges include:
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Class A)
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Class B)
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Class C)
5. NAT (Network Address Translation)
Due to the limited number of IPv4 addresses, NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet.
6. Exhaustion and Transition to IPv6
IPv4 addresses are limited to around 4.3 billion unique addresses, and due to the explosive growth of internet-connected devices, the pool of available addresses has largely been exhausted.
To address this, IPv6 was developed, offering a much larger address space (128-bit addresses).
IPv4 remains widely used, though there is an increasing shift toward IPv6 to address the limitations of the older system.
